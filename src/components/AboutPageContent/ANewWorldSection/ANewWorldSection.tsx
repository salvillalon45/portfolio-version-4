						When I enrolled at UC Irvine (UCI), I was
						Undecided/Undeclared student pursuing Electrical
						Engineering. Being on campus felt like stepping into a
						new world. I explored places like Chipotle and
						Yogurtland that were not in my hometown!

						There were so many extracurricular activities to choose
						from! I played tennis in high school and wanted to
						continue playing! I thought I could play for the NCAA
						tennis team, but the coach said otherwise. Then I looked
						for the Intramural Tennis Club competitive team, but I
						was not at the same level as those players. As I was
						training to improve my tennis game, I joined the Rowing
						Intramural Club to become a better tennis player!

						I was also involved in several organizations, including
						Circle K, the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers
						at UCI (SHPE-UCI), and the Student Retention & Outreach
						Center (SOAR). In addition, I worked as a busboy,
						dishwasher, and cook at the Lot 5 Eatery in Mesa Court.
